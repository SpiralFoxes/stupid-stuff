Umaru - a window manager that's like i3 but for stupid people like me, who can't configure every thing. Seriously, I hate Lua. It would have features like: 

actual wallpapers not controlled by a Lua file, 

a bar,

 Xresources-style configuration, 

a cool name, 

tiling but with some dynamic components so you can overlay a music player on top of whatever you're doing and toggle it with a hot key or something

Written in C, C++, Haskell, something speedy

Being almost as fast as keemstar

Have the bar also be modular, so if you have a bar you like, you can turn off umaru-bar and get something else

Fuck it,Make everything modular, even the key bind system.   UNIX PHILOSOPHY BOOOIIII

Emacs based, but again cause everything is modular you can switch that out for vi. (Why does everyone like vim again?

Basically, the Ubuntu of tiling window managers, for people who can't configure Debian(i3)
